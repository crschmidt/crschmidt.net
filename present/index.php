        <p>My  lightning talk called 'Geolocation with GSM Cells' at O'Reilly's <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/where2006/">Where 2.0 conference</a>, on June 13th, 2006 was mentioned in the <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71170-0.html?tw=wn_index_1">Wired Where 2.0 Roundup</a>.</p>
        <p>I spent a couple hours talking at BarCampBoston about various Geo-related things: Some links from that talk are <a href="/present/barcamp">now available</a>.</p>
